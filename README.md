## Short explanation
The provided code utilizes four main packages:

Provider: The provider package is used for state management in Flutter applications. It allows widgets to access and listen to changes in data provided by a ChangeNotifier or similar classes. In the provided code, ChangeNotifierProvider is used to provide an instance of AppModel to the widget tree, enabling components to listen for changes in the application state.

Dio: The dio package is a powerful HTTP client for Dart and Flutter applications. It simplifies the process of making HTTP requests and handling responses in Flutter applications. In the provided code, Dio is used to send requests to an API endpoint for fetching search results. It is configured with headers and parameters to customize the request according to the application's requirements.

Freezed: By utilizing Freezed, we can easily serialize and deserialize JSON data into Dart objects, and by using Dio, we can handle network requests efficiently in our Flutter application.

The infinite_scroll_pagination was used for pagination. This package is designed to simplify the implementation of infinite scrolling lists in  applications. It provides widgets and classes to manage paginated data fetching and display.



The SearchAPI class encapsulates the logic for making a search request to the server.
- It has a method named searchFoodApi which takes a FoodSearchCriteria object as a parameter.
- Inside the method, a POST request is made using Dio's post method from the dioClient.
- The request is made to the Endpoints.search URL with the provided data and headers.
- The response is then converted to a FoodSearchResponse object using its fromJson constructor.

App Model:
The AppModel class manages the state and logic related to searching for food items. It initializes a PagingController for pagination and a TextEditingController for the search input field. It also holds a future representing the search response and the search criteria. The _fetchPage method fetches a page of search results from the repository based on the current search criteria. The onSearch method updates the search criteria and triggers a search request. When the search response is received, it updates the PagingController. The class also disposes of the PagingController when no longer needed. This model follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to separate concerns and manage application state effectively.
